This is a second installment of my takeaways working on
[Juju](https://github.com/juju/juju) at Canonical.  See [Part
1](/2017/03/3.5yrs-500k-lines-of-go/) for the full intro.

At the end of the last post, I promised to talk about APIs, versioning, the
database, refactoring, logging, idioms, and code reviews.  So let's get started.

## APIs

### API Technology

Juju uses JSON RPC over websockets for communication, both server to server and
client to server.  This was a very good choice for us, in my opinion.  

REST may be popular with web developers, but I find its resource-oriented
approach to be entirely too limiting for basically any application more than a
simple storage server.  You start having to bend over backwards to make actions
look like CRUD. The classic case in REST is transferring money from one bank
account to another. The answer in REST is to make this into a Create of a
"Transfer" value that has a debit account and a credit account values.  Which is
horrible.

Writing code is 99% calling functions.  And RPC is just calling functions *over
there*. This is really what everyone wants to do, so how about we just let
people do it.

### API Versioning

When I joined Juju I learned that they intended the Juju API to be **both**
backward compatible and forward compatible.  At first, this seemed like a big
mistake.  Surely such restrictions would strangle innovation and make change
impossible.  Turns out this was not such a terrible idea.

As a product requirement, it makes sense for Juju.  Many users of Juju may have
multiple deployments of Juju running different versions.  Maybe you have some
really stable infrastructure on an older version that runs just fine.  You don't
want to touch it because there's really not reason.  And maybe you have some new
environments that you really want to be able to leverage the newest and best
features of Juju.  No one wants to have to keep a different CLI binary around
for each remote environment, what a pain.

Because we're running json RPC, it's fairly easy to keep backwards and forwards
compatibility.  Older versions of APIs will drop unknown fields in structs on
the floor when they unmarshal API values.  Thus, if you design new features
around new fields in a struct, then you can gracefully degrade functionality
when talking to an older server.  Maybe
